# huffman-project
My implementation of a Huffman encoder/decoder in C++.

I'm still in the prelimary steps of creating this, so the build and run instructions aren't complete (yet!).

Usage/build instructions:

After cloning the repo, use the command "make" in the root folder.
To run, use the command
    "./bin/huffman -f [FILENAME/FILEPATH] -[e(encode)/d(decode)]"
in the root folder as well.

The program will create a frequency tree based on the contents of the file and display it.

I added the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland into a .txt file to help demonstrate how it works.
